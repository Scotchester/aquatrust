            For more than a decade, the Ugandan Water Project,
            a 501(c)-3 charity based in the United States,
            has funded community water projects which
            have been implemented by Red Rhino Development,
            the Uganda-based NGO started by UWP
            to serve as an implementing agent for water projects.
            AquaTrust extends the values of UWP and Red Rhino
            into a sustainable maintenance service
            that allows communities in Uganda
            to keep their borehole handpumps working indefinitely.
